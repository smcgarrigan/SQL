# In this SQL, I'm querying a database with multiple tables in it to quantify statistics about customer and order data. 

#1. How many orders were placed in January?
SELECT COUNT(orderID)
FROM BIT_DB.JanSales 
WHERE length(orderID)=6
AND orderID<>'Order ID'
;

#2. How many of those orders were for an iPhone?
SELECT COUNT(orderID)
FROM BIT_DB.JanSales
Where Product='iPhone'
AND length(orderID)=6
AND orderID<>'Order ID'
;

#3. Select the customer account numbers for all the orders that were placed in February.
SELECT DISTINCT acctnum
FROM BIT_DB.customers cust
INNER JOIN BIT_DB.FebSales Feb
ON cust.order_id=Feb.orderID
WHERE length(orderID)=6
AND orderID<>'Order ID'
;

#4. Which product was the cheapest one sold in January, and what was the price?
SELECT Product, MIN(price)
FROM BIT_DB.JanSales
GROUP BY product, price
ORDER BY price asc
LIMIT 1
;

#5. What is the total revenue for each product sold in January?
SELECT SUM(quantity)*price AS Revenue
,Product
FROM BIT_DB.JanSales
GROUP BY product
;

#6. Which products were sold in February at 548 Lincoln St, Seattle, WA 98101, how many of each were sold, and what was the total revenue?

FROM BIT_DB.FebSales
WHERE location='548 Lincoln St, Seattle, WA 98101'
GROUP BY product
;

#7. How many customers ordered more than 2 products at a time in February, and what was the average amount spent for those customers?
SELECT COUNT(cust.acctnum)AS number_of_customers
,AVG(quantity*price)AS average_amount_spent
FROM BIT_DB.FebSales Feb
LEFT JOIN BIT_DB.customers cust
ON Feb.orderID=cust.order_id
WHERE Feb.Quantity>2
AND length(orderID)=6
